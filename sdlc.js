// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Analyse what's needed to complete the new version of software. Things like languages, external hosting, third party software, etc." 
const design = "Sofware developers define the technical details needed to start coding solutions.  How files are organized, etc." 
const implementation = "Software developers develop the code." 
const testingAndIntegration = "Software is checked for quality and compatibility with other systems in this phase.  Developers make the new software available for team members to test and evaluate." 
const maintain = "Software is mainatained for quality and availability (bug fixes, updated for integration, etc.)"
